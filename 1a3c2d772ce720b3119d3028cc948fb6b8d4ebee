      "message": "If I may provide an unbiased opinion here: Disabling Debugging generally doesn\u0027t sound like a bad idea, however could make bug reports coming from users with weird devices a lot harder. If the logging isn\u0027t too extreme I\u0027d keep it enabled in favour of debugging in case of user reports. Especially with all the weird NFC chips out there we may depend on user reports as we may not have access to a specific NFC chip type.\n\n@Georg, as for your castor NFC issues: If thats an issue I\u0027d recommend moving to a device specific config whichs makefile overrides the shinano NFC config.",
